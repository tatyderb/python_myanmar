Преобразовывая каждую букву в число, соответствующее ее порядковому номеру в алфавите (считаем, что букве А соответствует порядковый номер 1), и складывая эти значения, мы получим числовое значение слова. Для примера, числовое значение слова `SKY` равно 19 + 11 + 25 = 55

Даны слова (заглавные латинские буквы). Отсортировать по убыванию числового значения, при одинаковом числовом значении, сортировать по алфавиту.

## TASKINLINE Вариант 15, задача 5

n-ый член последовательности треугольных чисел задается как $t_n = n*(n+1)/2$. Таким образом, первые десять треугольных чисел:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Преобразовывая каждую букву в число, соответствующее ее порядковому номеру в алфавите (считаем, что букве А соответствует порядковый номер 1), и складывая эти значения, мы получим числовое значение слова. Для примера, числовое значение слова SKY равно $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_{10}$. Если числовое значение слова является треугольным числом, то мы назовем это слово треугольным словом.

Даны слова через пробел (заглавные латинские буквы). Напечатать только треугольные слова, одно слово на строку. В том же порядке, что были во входной последовательности.

На новой строке количество треугольных слов.

Входные слова не длиннее 30 букв.

Алфавит: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
